# AI Programming with Python Project

This project is split into two main parts:

- An image classifier using a neural network, created in a Jupyter Notebook using PyTorch

- A command line application written in Python to use the image classifier in various instances

<!-- The image classifier was  -->

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.
